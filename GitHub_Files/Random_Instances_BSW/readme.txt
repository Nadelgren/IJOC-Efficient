This folder contains random instances of the Biobjective Mixed Integer Linear Program (BOMILP) that were obtained
from Pietro Belotti, Banu Soylu and Margaret M. Wiecek, authors of "Fathoming rules for biobjective mixed integer 
linear programs: Review and extensions," published in "Discrete Optimization" in 2016.

Each instance of BOMILP is stored in two *.lp files, testp1.lp and testp2.lp. The two files have identical 
feasible sets, but different objectives.
