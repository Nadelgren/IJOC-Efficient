This folder contains C code that serves as an example of how one may implement the binary tree described in
the paper "Efficient storage of Pareto points in biobjective mixed integer programming," published in 
INFORMS Journal on Computing in 2017. 

This code is not intended to be compiled into an executable, but just to provide the functions necessary
for implementing the data structure.
